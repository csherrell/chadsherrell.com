Hello,

I am Chad Sherrell and own the domain chadsherrell.com.  I do have an entry for sherrell.net also using freedns.afraid.org with username csherrell.  I want to add chadsherrell.com to the csherrell account, but someone with the username riabebugob1980 is squatting on it.  I have the chadsherrell.com registered till 2024.

Please let me know what steps I need to take to reclaim my domain from this user.

Thank you,

Chad Sherrell
